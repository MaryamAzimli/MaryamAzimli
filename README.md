Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maryam, and I am 20.

Senior Computer Engineering student at Bilkent University.

My core skill set includes:

  - Node.js & Express.js: I've built robust backend applications using Node.js and Express.js, focusing on creating efficient APIs and server-side logic.
  - Java, Python, & C++: I have a solid foundation in these languages.
  - Mobile App Development: My passion lies in mobile app development, where I enjoy bringing ideas to life on Android and iOS platforms. I thrive on creating user-friendly and performant
    mobile applications. One of mobile app projects have worked on is GameSuggester that suggests similar games based on choosen tags using machine learning.
  - Web Development: Although my primary focus is on mobile apps, I have also gained experience in web development, building responsive and interactive websites.
